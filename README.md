*Explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.*
**Installation**
1. Fork this repo
2. Clone to your computer using `git clone git@github.com:utamilah/khwiki.git`

**Approach**
I wanted to build a very simple CRUD application that will allow users to navigate and learn about Worlds and their Characters. While working on the basic functionality I wanted to create something visually pleasing for the user to to play with.

**Unsolved Problems**
Unfortunately I was unable to provide strict admin access for editing worlds. Currently anyone can make an account and have full CRUD access. This means anyone can delete titles, text, and entire entities and they would be allowed to.

**Credit**

**User Stories**
1. A user should be able to create an account, log in and edit content.
2. A user should be able to navigate through the site and read content.
3. A user can add new content.
